CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) environment variables are key-value pairs that are used during the CI/CD process to store configuration settings, secrets, and other necessary information that is needed to build, test, and deploy applications. These variables help make CI/CD pipelines more flexible, dynamic, and secure.

**Global Variables**
Global Variables: These variables are available across all stages, jobs, or pipelines within a CI/CD project. For example, database URLs, API endpoints, and external service credentials might be set as global variables.

**Job-Specific Variables**: 
These are specific to individual jobs within the pipeline. You can define variables that will only apply to a particular job, like temporary values for testing.

**stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  variables:
    BUILD_DIR: "/build/output"  # Job-specific variable
  script:
    - echo "Building the project"
    - mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR}
    - echo "Build files will be saved to ${BUILD_DIR}"

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."**
    
**Environment-specific variables**
Environment-specific variables in a CI/CD pipeline are used to handle different configurations for different environments like **development**, **staging**, and **production**. These variables allow you to define settings that vary depending on where the application is deployed. For example, you may want different API keys, database URLs, or other credentials for each environment.

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  DATABASE_URL: "default-database-url"  # Default value

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Testing the project..."

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to ${CI_ENVIRONMENT_NAME} environment"
    - echo "Using database: ${DATABASE_URL}"
  
# Environment-specific variables for development
deploy-dev:
  stage: deploy
  environment:
    name: development
  variables:
    DATABASE_URL: "dev-database-url"
    API_KEY: "dev-api-key"
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to Development"
    - echo "Database URL: ${DATABASE_URL}"
    - echo "API Key: ${API_KEY}"

# Environment-specific variables for staging
deploy-staging:
  stage: deploy
  environment:
    name: staging
  variables:
    DATABASE_URL: "staging-database-url"
    API_KEY: "staging-api-key"
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to Staging"
    - echo "Database URL: ${DATABASE_URL}"
    - echo "API Key: ${API_KEY}"

# Environment-specific variables for production
deploy-prod:
  stage: deploy
  environment:
    name: production
  variables:
    DATABASE_URL: "prod-database-url"
    API_KEY: "prod-api-key"
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to Production"
    - echo "Database URL: ${DATABASE_URL}"
    - echo "API Key: ${API_KEY}"
